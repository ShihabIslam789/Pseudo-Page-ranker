# What are Eigen vectors and Eigen values
 Eigen vectors are vectors is a container of integers that are immutable except when it is a scaled verison of the origanl vector. <br>
 Eigen vectors are meant to help calculate approximations of larger matrices  as a small vector. Usually it is used make Linear transformations <br>
 easier to understand. The Eigen values are the integers from the Eigen Vectors that change the magnitude of it. <br>
# Project Premise
This project is meant to simulate the process of how web searches function. I created eigen vectors to simulate how a computer can go from <br>
one webpage to another webpage. the internet is actually a map and each weblink people use on any web search website gos from one place to another 
in the vast space that is the cloud internet. I simulate this map using Eigen vectors to show that webpages are connected and linked to each other. 
The numbers genrated are the differnt links that are topics related to each other that the internet suggests a person to slick and look at. <br>
